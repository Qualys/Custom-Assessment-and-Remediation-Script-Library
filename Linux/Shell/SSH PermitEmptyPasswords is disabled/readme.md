The PermitEmptyPasswords parameter specifies if the SSH server allows login to accounts with empty password strings.  

Disallowing remote shell access to accounts that have an empty password reduces the probability of unauthorized access to the system.  

This script will check if empty password is prohibited or not and if empty password is allowed then the script will change it to not allow empty password.
