# Security Update – make sure to install pax/spax

All Zimbra administrators should make sure the pax package is installed on their Zimbra server. Pax is needed by Amavis to extract the contents of compressed attachments for virus scanning.

If the pax package is not installed, Amavis will fall-back to using cpio, unfortunately the fall-back is implemented poorly (by Amavis) and will allow an unauthenticated attacker to create and overwrite files on the Zimbra server, including the Zimbra webroot.

For most Ubuntu servers the pax package should already be installed as it is a dependency of Zimbra. Due to a packaging change in CentOS, there is a high chance pax is not installed.

You should validate and install pax on all your systems as follows:

**Ubuntu**  
apt install pax

**CentOS 7 and derivatives**  
yum install pax

**CentOS 8 and derivatives**  
dnf install spax

**Restart Zimbra using:** 
```
sudo su zimbra -
zmcontrol restart
```
