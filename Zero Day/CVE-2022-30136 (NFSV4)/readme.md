Windows Network File System Remote Code Execution Vulnerability CVE-2022-30136 (NFSV4) 

To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must succeed in a race condition. Making an unauthenticated, carefully constructed call to a Network File System (NFS) service could be used to exploit this vulnerability over the network remotely. 

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors might be helpful in your situation:

This vulnerability is not exploitable in NFSV2.0 or NFSV3.0. Prior to updating your version of Windows that protects against this vulnerability, you can mitigate an attack by disabling NFSV4.1. This could adversely affect your ecosystem and should only be used as a temporary mitigation.

Warning You should NOT apply this mitigation unless you have installed the May 2022 Windows security updates. Those updates address CVE-2022-26937 which is a Critical vulnerability in NFSV2.0 and NFSV3.0.

The following PowerShell command will disable NFSV4:

Set-NfsServerConfiguration -EnableNFSV4 $false

After this, you will need to restart NFS server or reboot the machine.

To restart NFS server, start a cmd window with Run as Administrator, enter the following commands:

nfsadmin server stop
nfsadmin server start

To re-enable NFSv4.1 after you have installed the June 2022 security update, enter the following command:

Set-NfsServerConfiguration -EnableNFSV4 $True
