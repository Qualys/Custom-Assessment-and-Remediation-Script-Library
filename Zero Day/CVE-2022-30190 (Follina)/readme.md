# Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2022-30190)      
    
Security researchers have discovered a new zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Office, via Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), that could be exploited to achieve code execution on affected systems simply by opening a malicious Word document.     
      
The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2022-30190, was discovered by a Japanese security researcher nao_sec, who tweeted a warning about the zero-day over the weekend. Security researcher Kevin Beaumont named the vulnerability “Follina” because the spotted sample on the file references 0438, which is the area code of Follina in Italy.     
    
## Workaround:  
     
Microsoft has recommended disabling the MSDT URL protocol as a temporary fix. Disabling the MSDT URL protocol prevents troubleshooters from being launched as links, including links throughout the operating system. The following steps can be taken to disable the MSDT protocol.    
      
1. Back up the registry key and execute the command 'reg export HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt filename'    
2. Execute the script which delete HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt key and start VM on demand scan.
