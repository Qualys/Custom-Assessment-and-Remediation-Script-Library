Take Action

To help protect your environment and prevent outages, we recommend that you do the following steps:

UPDATE your Windows domain controllers with a Windows update released on or after November 8, 2022.

MOVE your Windows domain controllers to Audit mode by using the Registry Key setting section.

MONITOR events filed during Audit mode to secure your environment.

ENABLE Enforcement mode to address CVE-2022-37967 in your environment.

Note Step 1 of installing updates released on or after November 8, 2022 will NOT address the security issues in CVE-2022-37967â€¯for Windows devices by default. To fully mitigate the security issue for all devices, you must move to Audit mode (described in Step 2) followed by Enforced mode (described in Step 4) as soon as possible on all Windows domain controllers.
